# Configure Sequencing (/en/docs/syndicate-stack/guides/config-sequencing)

## How Onchain Sequencing Works

1. **Users submit transactions** to the appchain's mempool
2. **The execution engine** processes transactions by validating and coordination transactions
3. **Sequencing modules on the sequencing chain** control permissions, ordering, auctions, and atomic execution
4. **The settlement layer** finalizes state with periodic commitments

This architecture decouples execution from transaction ordering, enabling innovation in sequencing while maintaining compatibility with existing execution environments.

## Compose Modules

Combine modules to create sophisticated sequencing solutions using our factory contract:

```solidity
// Deploy the factory
SyndicateFactory factory = new SyndicateFactory();

// Create a RequireAll module for combining multiple checks
RequireAllModule permissions = RequireAllModule(
    factory.createAllContractsWithRequireAllModule(
        admin,
        manager,
        l3ChainId,
        salt
    ).permissionModule
);

// Add permission checks
permissions.addCheck(
    address(new TokenBalanceSequencingModule(token, minBalance)),
    true // add to head of list
);
permissions.addCheck(
    address(new AllowlistSequencingModule(admin)),
    false // add to tail of list
);
```

#### Composition Features

* **RequireAll**: All checks must pass (AND logic)
* **RequireAny**: At least one check must pass (OR logic)
* **Linked List Structure**: Checks are stored in an ordered list
* **Dynamic Updates**: Add or remove checks at runtime
* **Admin Control**: Only admin can modify composition

## Getting Started

1. **Choose Your Modules**: Review the available modules and select those that match your security, fairness, and performance requirements. If needed, plan custom modules to meet specific needs.

2. **Implement Custom Logic**: Build new modules by implementing our interfaces and test them thoroughly using our development tools.

3. **Configure Your Chain**: Deploy and initialize your chain with the selected modules.

4. **Monitor and Upgrade**: Track performance metrics and upgrade modules as needed using our modular architecture to ensure optimal chain operation.
